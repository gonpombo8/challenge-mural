Bonus points 1: 

I calculate the browser max height and store it.

```javascript
function maxHeightScroll() {
	var documentHeight = document.documentElement.scrollHeight;
	var windowHeight = window.innerHeight;
	return documentHeight - windowHeight;
}
```
When user scrolls, i get the scroll bar height position.
```javascript
window.pageYOffset
```
With this two variables, i could calculate the percentage of the scroll bar position, so another device with different resolution could see the same text part.
It only has to multiplicate the percentage height with the total height px, which is calculate with the maxHeightScroll function.
```javascript
	var height = scroll.percentage * maxHeightScroll();
```


Bonus point 2

To keep the last read position of each document, i will use redis and mongodb.
It doesnt have to much sense to save all the height position send by the user, because when the user starts scrolling maybe it sends a lot of positions. The last position is what it really matters to save, so i think to use the scrollTimeout function declared before to save the last position after 500ms of not receiving data.
I would save the scroll height and the document room on redis and mongodb. When an user connects, will search on redis if that document has a height position and send it, if not query to mongodb. If there's no data, it means that is a new document and nobody see it.
